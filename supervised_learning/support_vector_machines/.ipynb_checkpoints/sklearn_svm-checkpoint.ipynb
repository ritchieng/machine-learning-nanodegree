    "- Support vector machines are models that learn to differentiate between data in two categories based on past examples\n",
    "- We want to have the maximum margin from the line to the points as shown in the diagram and that is the essence of SVMs\n",
    "    - The points close to the decision boundary matters, the rest are not important\n",
    "    - Note that SVMs aim to classify correctly before maximizing the margin\n",
